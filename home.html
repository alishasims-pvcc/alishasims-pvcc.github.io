    <h1 style="color: #e50909; text-align: center;">Why is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Important?</h1>

    <table border = "1" style ="width: 50%; color: #000000; background-color: rgb(204, 204, 230, 90%); margin: auto; text-align: left;">
        <tr>
            <td>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is important because it provides support and offers resources to Veterans, service members and their families. Support and care dated back to the beginning of American history. When service members were wounded or died in service it left those families with the financial burden. Because of the large amount of wounded and deceased militia after each war, laws have been updated and added to offer support and care. In 1988 President Ronald Reagan signed a bill turning the Veterans Administration into the Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs. In 1989, when George H.W. Bush became President, the law went into effect. Veterans Affairs comes in 2nd to the Department of Defense among Federal Agencies. There are 3 components to make up the Department of Veterans affairs: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA, est. 1946), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA, est. 1953), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA, est. 1973). Denis R. McDonough currently serves as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Tanya Brasher serves as the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the second highest ranking officer and serves as the Chief Operating Officer.  The mission of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs is to fulfill President Lincoln's promise - "to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his widow, and his orphan" - by serving and honoring the men and women who are America's Veterans. The dept of VA values are, Compassion, Commitment, Excellence, Professionalism, Integrity, Accountability, and Stewardship. Because this department is so important to so many people, there are opportunities for people that are not members of service or Veterans to volunteer or donate. You can volunteer with the Caregiver Support Program, Compassionate Contact Corps, Corporate Volunteerism, Student Volunteers, National Salute to Veteran Patients, Volunteer Transportation Network, or Physician Ambassador. You can donate online or at a facility. There are 2 holidays dedicated to Veterans, Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Memorial Day, which is celebrated on the last Monday in May, is the annual day to honor and mourn deceased service members. Veterans Day, celebrated each year on November 11th, is intended to honor and thank the men and women Veterans who have served this country in all wars.</td>
